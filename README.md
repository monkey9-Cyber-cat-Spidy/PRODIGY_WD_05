## How It Works 🤔

1. **Geocoding:**  
   The app uses the Nominatim API to convert your location (city, state, or country) into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). 🌍

2. **Fetching Weather Data:**  
   With your coordinates, the app calls the Open‑Meteo API to retrieve current weather along with hourly and daily forecasts, including temperature data. 🔄

3. **Rendering Data:**  
   The app dynamically builds HTML tables to display:
   - **Location Information**
   - **Current Weather**
   - **Hourly Forecast**
   - **Daily Forecast**  
   All shown with an easy-to-read layout. 📝

4. **Animations:**  
   GSAP adds smooth animations to page elements (header, form, data container, and download button) to create a lively, interactive experience. 💫

5. **JSON Download:**  
   The full JSON response is stored and linked to a download button, so you can download the complete weather data whenever you need it. 📂
